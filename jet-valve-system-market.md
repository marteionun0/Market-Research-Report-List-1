<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Jet Valve System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Jet Valves</li><li>Non-contact Jet Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Jet Valve System market is divided into two main types: contact jet valves and non-contact jet valves. Contact jet valves operate by creating a direct interaction between the jet stream and the surface being treated, making them suitable for applications requiring precision and surface adherence. In contrast, non-contact jet valves utilize air or fluid jets to operate without physical contact, which allows for applications in delicate processes and minimizes contamination risks. Both types serve diverse industries, including manufacturing and healthcare.</p></p>
