<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyimide Fibre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Spinning Process</li><li>Dry Spinning Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Polyimide Fibre market can be classified based on the spinning processes used: wet and dry spinning. In the wet spinning process, polyimide polymers are dissolved in a solvent and extruded into a coagulation bath, leading to the formation of continuous fibres. This method is beneficial for producing high-performance fibres with excellent mechanical properties. Conversely, the dry spinning process involves dissolving polyimides in a volatile solvent, which evaporates, leaving behind solid fibres. This technique allows for faster production and scalability.</p></p>
